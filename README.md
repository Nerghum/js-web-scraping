# Web Scraper

The Web Scraper is a JavaScript-based tool that allows you to extract and display content from a web page based on a specified URL and a CSS selector (ID or class name). This README provides instructions on how to use the tool and explains its functionality.

## Features

- Extract content from a web page using a URL.
- Specify a CSS selector (ID or class name) to target a specific section of the web page.
- Display the scraped content within a designated div.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. You will see a simple form with the following fields:
   - **Enter URL:** Enter the URL of the web page you want to scrape.
   - **Enter Section ID or Class:** Enter the CSS selector (ID or class name) of the section you want to scrape.

3. After filling out the form, click the "Scrape Content" button.

4. The web scraper will fetch the content from the specified URL, parse it, and extract the content within the specified section.

5. The extracted content will be displayed inside the "result" div on the same page.

6. If the specified element is not found or if there's an error during the fetch, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the web scraper by modifying the JavaScript code in the `index.html` file. The code is located within the `<script>` tag and can be adjusted to meet your specific requirements.

- To change the appearance or styling of the page, you can modify the HTML and CSS in the `index.html` file.
